# Adventures in Financial Data Science
Here I am collecting the scripts I have used to prepare my book "Adventures in Financial Data Science" and to support my other writing, such as that on Medium. Those for the book are mostly originally written for the RATS time-series analysis system, which is commercial software, so I have begun porting the code to Python Notebooks written for Google's colab https://colab.research.google.com. This is mostly what I will post here. The figures for the book will be generated by notebooks titled "Section n.n.n Section Title" etc. It is my intention to release a book titled "Financial Data Science in Python" which incorporates all of this work and the descriptive prose necessary, but which could be thought of as a "study guide" for the "Adventures..." book.

I am also including notebooks which support some of my writing on Medium, but they may be moved to an other repo at a suitable time.
